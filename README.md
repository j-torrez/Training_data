# Training_data
You get (A) 4 training datasets and (B) one test dataset, as well as (C) datasets for 50 ideal functions. All data respectively consists of x-y-pairs of values. 
Structure of all CSV-files provided:
X Y
x1 y1
... ...
xn yn

A Python-program that uses training data to choose the four ideal functions which are the
best fit out of the fifty provided

i)Afterwards, the program must use the test data provided (B) to determine for each and every x-ypair of values whether or not they can be assigned to the four chosen ideal functions**; if so, the
program also needs to execute the mapping and save it together with the deviation at hand
ii) All data must be visualized logically
iii) Where possible, create/ compile suitable unit-test
